# CSS - Playground

Have come across any new implementation of CSS or just want to dive deep into the some existing concept. 
Here is my personal notebook of CSS that will consist live examples as well as notes. I will try to keep 
it minimal and simple so it can benefit others.

## Get Started - Simple Architecture

To keep things simple I have not used any front-end framework. It is simple HTML 5 Boilerplate. So can concentrate only on CSS part and can have maximum flexibility when it comes with some experiments.

### Installing

For now nothing is needed, just any server should be installed on your machine to serve the pages.
If no server is installed. Easiest way to go is just install `http-server`. Which will do the job and 
it is easily available.

To know more about http server: [Http Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
To install: `npm install http-server -g` 

**Please Note:**
- *It will install http-server globally.*
- *I expect you have node js installed.* If not please follow the link [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
