    <h1>CSS Specificity</h1>

    <p>
        Specificity is the means by which a browser decides which CSS property values are 
        the most relevant to an element and therefore will be applied. Specificity is only 
        based on the matching rules which are composed of CSS selectors of different sorts.

    <h3>CSS Terminology</h3>
    <p>
        Before diving deep let us get to know some terminology related to CSS and this concept.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><h5>Selector: </h5> Selectors will let you select particular element. 
            That can be selected by element selector, class selector, id selector.
        </li>
        <li><h5>Pseudo class: </h5> Pseudo classes used to select special state of element.</li>
        <li><h5>Pseudo element: </h5> Pseudo elements are used to style specified parts of elements</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h3>How to calculate</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>We can seperate CSS rules to 4 main categories and each of them adds different value to specificity score.</li>
        <li>The correct notation of specificity score takes a form that separates points by coma in an appropriate order. i.e. (0,0,0,0)</li>
        <li>Now let's start adding: 
            <ol>
                <li>Inline Style: Always take precedence. Adds (1,0,0,0) to the score.</li>
                <li>ID: Each Id adds (0,1,0,0) to the score.</li>
                <li>Class, Pseudo-Class and Attribute: They adds (0,0,1,0) to the score.</li>
                <li>Element, Pseudo-Element: They adds (0,0,0,1) to the score.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Few exceptions to keep in mind:
            <ol>
                <li><span>!important</span> can override the inline style.</li>
                <li>Selector inside the <span>:not</span> Pseudo-Class gets counted. 
                    The Pseudo-Class itself does not gets counted.
                </li>
                <li>Tie! If two selectors have same specificity, Order will come into play.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
